## 📖 About

**Samsung SmartCap** is a feature-rich, mobile-first smart home energy dashboard built on the Samsung SmartThings ecosystem concept. It gives homeowners a powerful, visually engaging interface to monitor live power consumption, remotely control connected appliances, and earn rewards for saving energy — all from a single beautiful web app.

The centerpiece of the app is a **real-time 3D WebGL rendering** of your apartment using Three.js, allowing you to visualize your home energy state with dynamic lighting that reacts to each appliance status.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or higher
- npm v9 or higher

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/samsung-smartcap.git
cd samsung-smartcap

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at **http://localhost:5173** (Vite will pick the next available port if 5173 is in use).

### Build for Production

```bash
# Type-check and compile
npm run build

# Preview the production build locally
npm run preview
```

## 🎨 Design System

SmartCap uses a **Neo-Brutalist** design language:

- **Heavy borders** — all cards and buttons have a solid 4px `#2D3436` border
- **Offset drop shadows** — `box-shadow: 0 8px 0 0 #2D3436` creates a physical 3D depth effect
- **Press-down physics** — interactive elements translate Y on hover/click, shrinking their shadow to simulate a real button press
- **Bold color palette**:
  - Electric Blue `#3498DB` — info, active states
  - Lime Green `#2ECC71` — ON state, savings
  - Golden Yellow `#F1C40F` — highlights, rewards
  - Coral Red `#E74C3C` — danger, high power
  - Charcoal `#2D3436` — borders, text

## 📦 Using Custom 3D Models

The app supports uploading your own home model:

1. Prepare a `.zip` archive containing:
   - A `.glb` or `.gltf` 3D model file
   - Any associated texture files (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.bin`, etc.)
2. Navigate to the **3D Home** tab
3. Use the hidden file input (id `zipUpload`) to upload the archive
4. The app unpacks the zip, maps texture paths to in-memory blobs, and renders your model
